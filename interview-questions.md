# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: `This` refers to an object calling upon itself. Developers can call upon values within an object while inside that same object. 

  Researched answer: `This` is a way to refer to the object when you are inside of said object. It can also be used alone (refers to a global object in this case. )



2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer: React is a js library that is used to develop the UI for end users

  Researched answer: React (aka React.js) is a Javascript library that is used to build user interfaces by using components. It was developed by facebook in 2013. It can be used to build webpages, apps, games, and more.



3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer: The constructor() is required in React

  Researched answer: After looking it up, the only required lifecycle method required is the render() method. Constructor(), according to the React website, does NOT need to be implemented in all cases. An example of this case would be if you don't bind any methods in your app. 



4. What is JSX? What is one notable difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer: JSX = JS + HTML specifically designed for React. I believe the difference is that JSX allows developers to write in both languages at the same time. 

  Researched answer: One notable difference between HTML and JSX is that JSX demands the usage of fragments `<> </>` in order to compile. Also, all tags are self-closing tags in JSX; you can just write something like <br /> instead of <br></br>. Lastly, all attributes are written in camelCase for JSX.



5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: Yarn is used when building React applications. It lets developers install and run their code in the browser. 

  Researched answer: Yarn is a package manager for code. A package manager is basically a collection of programs that are in charge of installing and configuring programs so the developer doesn't have to. This gives everyone the same build to work on.



6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: I've never heard of an anonymous function. TO GOOGLE!!!

  Researched answer: An anonymous function is a function without a name. When storing a function inside of a variable, it doesn't need to be named. It can also be a self-executing function.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: Exactly what it sounds like. React components can be given conditions that need to be met before they are rendered. On the react website, they give a nice example dealing with the login process. If a user is signed up for the website, they will get a nice welcome message. If not, the site will prompt them to register for an account.

2. Props: READ ONLY. Props are function arguments in JS and are used in parent/child classes (parent --> child). 

3. JavaScript Events: Basically, JS events can be anything that happens when a user interacts with elements on the page. For example, what should happen when a user clicks this button? What happens when they close the page? What about if they do this certain action? Etc etc.

4. Object-oriented programming: A type of programming that places an emphasis on objects and classes. Relies on the idea that code can (and should be) reused over and over again to achieve similar results. No need to reinvent the wheel.

5. Ruby: A high level language where everything is an object. Made in Japan by Yukihiro Matsumoto. In Ruby, everything is seen as an object. There is little punctuation in Ruby; there are more 'plain english' keywords.
